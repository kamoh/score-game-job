                    Hi there, and thanks for making it this far! I got my start in games in 2004 as an intern on an online text-based game. Since then, I've worked on all sorts of different game projects across a ton of platforms, companies, genres and audiences.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm fascinated by the different ways people make it into games, and I always try to pass on the benefit of my experience when I meet people earnestly trying to find a way to break in themselves.
                    <br><br>
                    It took me years to learn what I've put down in this eBook. My hope is that it can be of use to you.
                    <br><br>
